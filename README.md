## Description

AI programmed in python to recognize digits.  
The goal is to reach the max score using only Machine Learning.

**Note**
> A Deep Learning CNN model could have reach that max score easily, but I wanted to test what might reach the common
> Machine Learning classifier.

I try to use a wide variety of models. I got the best scores with Stacked model and Voting Classifier composed of SVM,
RandomForestClassifier and KnnClassifier.

## Quick start
